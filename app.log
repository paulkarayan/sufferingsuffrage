I estimate that there is an 80% chance that your voting suggestion is accurate. \n\nProposition 16: Repeal of Proposition 209, Affirmative Action: I think you would care a lot and would be likely to vote no on this proposition. Proposition 16 would repeal Proposition 209, which prohibited the consideration of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in public education, employment, and contracting decisions. You may feel that this type of affirmative action discriminates against people who are more qualified and don\u2019t need it. I estimate that there is an 80% chance that your voting suggestion is accurate. \n\nProposition 17: Voting Rights Restoration for Persons on Parole: I think you would care a lot and would be likely to vote yes on this proposition. Proposition 17 would restore the right to vote to people on parole for felony convictions. You likely strongly support the idea"

You value individual liberty and value the freedom to make one's own decisions, which supports the idea that research should be funded and people should be allowed to make their own decisions about scientific research. This proposition is also in line with your belief that government should not censor speech, press, media or internet, as it involves the funding of scientific research. I estimate there is a 90% likelihood that you would vote yes on this proposition. \n\nProposition 15: Increasing Taxes on Large Businesses to Fund Public Schools: \nI think you would care moderately about this proposition and would likely vote no. You believe in limited government intervention and reducing taxes and government spending by 50% or more. This proposition would increase taxes on large businesses to fund public schools, which goes against your core libertarian beliefs. I estimate there is a 75% likelihood you would vote no on this proposition. \n\nProposition 16: Repealing Proposition 209, which Prohibited Affirmative Action:\nI think you would care moderately about this proposition and would likely vote no.
