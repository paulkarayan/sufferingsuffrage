I estimate that there is an 80% chance that your voting suggestion is accurate. \n\nProposition 16: Repeal of Proposition 209, Affirmative Action: I think you would care a lot and would be likely to vote no on this proposition. Proposition 16 would repeal Proposition 209, which prohibited the consideration of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in public education, employment, and contracting decisions. You may feel that this type of affirmative action discriminates against people who are more qualified and don\u2019t need it. I estimate that there is an 80% chance that your voting suggestion is accurate. \n\nProposition 17: Voting Rights Restoration for Persons on Parole: I think you would care a lot and would be likely to vote yes on this proposition. Proposition 17 would restore the right to vote to people on parole for felony convictions. You likely strongly support the idea"
